# Image Search Abstraction Using Bing Web Search API

This is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS and MongoDB. I used frameworks like Bootstrap and ExpressJS. I also used packages like Mongoose to help manage database. And most importantly, I used Bing Web Search API to make this app possible by using node-bing-api package.
